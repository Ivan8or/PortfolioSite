    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="backstory">
        My first interests related to code were... unprincipled.
    </h2>
    <h3 class="backstory">
        As a senior in high school, one class held in a computer room had very little work,
        so me and my friends found ourselves with plenty of free time.
        <br><br>
        Since the computers were heavily restricted with only a few options for entertainment,
        we were limited in how we could enjoy our spare moments. Besides talking, the most
        we could do was annoy each other and our classmates.
        <br><br>
        After one particularly egregious day of being poked and prodded by a friend,
        I decided that I had had enough and that I would need to step things up to make myself feel better.
        <br><br>
        Since I was taking classes on java programming for the past three years, I decided to
        try my hand at making a 'real' program instead of one of our regular class excercises.
        <br><br>
        I came up with a small app which when executed on someone's computer, would occasionally
        open up incriminating chrome tabs (eg. anthropomorphic fruit). It also had the ability to
        slowly drift the mouse cursor, and even copy files across the network with the proper configuration.
        <br><br>
        My favorite feature, however, was that this program would bury itself in the *student restricted*
        startup folder of the computer. The poor victim wouldn't be able to get rid of the program
        even after rebooting, and would have to ask me to remove it with my specially made file deletion app.
        <br><br>
        I sadly never got much of an opportunity to make full use of this program, since anyone afflicted
        would almost immediately demand I remove it. Still, this experience showed me that I was capable
        of making software to indulge my whims, and inspired me to continue pursuing software development
        so that I could always make my life more enjoyable.
