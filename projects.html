            <h4>Introduction:</h4>
            <p>
                When I was developing my dockerized university minecraft network,
                I found the need for my server instances to communicate with each
                other as well as with my bungeecord proxy. While the minecraft Bukkit
                API does have some support for this type of communication via plugin 
                messaging, their solution is not free of shortcomings. Most relevant
                to my situation is that their messaging will not work for a server that
                has 0 players online - which is unacceptable for my usecase where I
                will often want to communicate with a server that just launched or 
                that is about to be shut down. There are some excellent solutions
                that do what I need (namely Redis / RabbitMQ / most any other message 
                brokers), but I felt the need to stick to the spirit of DIY and implement
                my own messaging system. 
            </p>
            <h4>Design Considerations:</h4>
            <p>
                Most message broker solutions are a middleware, where the user needs to
                host an application service which then manages communications sent through
                it. This allows messages to be queued if the recipient is unreachable, 
                as well as multicast messages efficiently. For my usecase, however, I 
                consider this extra functionality to be mostly unneeded and even a 
                detriment. I want a system which would be ready to use without
                any special setup, tailored to hobby spigot developers who simply want 
                a reliable way for two servers to communicate. This is especially relevant
                when considering that most minecraft managed hosting providers will not offer
                an easy way to deploy extra services (besides possibly an SQL database), 
                meaning that using a standard message broker would require server owners
                to break away from the streamlined process of running a managed server.
