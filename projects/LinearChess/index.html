<h4>Introduction:</h4>
            <p>
                I was tutoring someone struggling with their CS classes over covid, and 
                one of their assignments was related to building a chess AI. 
                The assignment itself was straightforward: the AI would use the minimax
                algorithm to determine its moves, and all the student needed to do was
                implement several viable evaluation functions and compare them.
                The following few hours were some of the most interesting of my entire
                time working with any school assignment: throwing together a function 
                that calculated simple heuristics resulted in an AI that behaved exactly 
                as you expected it to. A single edit resulted in vastly different 
                behavior, with the possibility to make meaningful changes in seconds.
                This experience has stuck in the back of my mind for years, and I have
                recently finally gotten around to trying my hand at implementing
                a multiplayer game inspired by this satisfying responsiveness.
                <br>
                P.S. This project is still a work in progress, but I'm taking steps every
                day to reach my goal of an MVP that me and my friends online can play!

            <h4>Design Considerations:</h4>
            <p>
                The bulk of the backend logic for this game is developed in Java, as 
                that is both the language I am the most comfortable with for large 
                projects, as well as being a solid middle ground between being 
                relatively performant while still allowing for a smooth development
                experience thanks to it having automatic memory management, 
                static typing, and support for the OOP paradigm. 
                <br>
                For the frontend UI, I chose React.js: I'm not overly concerned with
                client-side rendering being a performance issue for this kind of app,
                and React has a lot of community support (which goes a long way for a
                novice front-end developer like myself).
                <br>
                I have not commited to any particular database for this project yet. 
                but I am leaning towards choosing a relational database like MySQL
                or Postgres for their high performance with just a single instance.
